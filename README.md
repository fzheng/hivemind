**HyperMind** is a collective intelligence trading system that learns from the best traders on Hyperliquid. Instead of relying on traditional technical analysis or blindly copy-trading single wallets, HyperMind aggregates wisdom from top-performing traders and generates consensus-based trading signals.

> "Be as smart as the smartest traders by learning from their collective behavior"

## What It Does

- **Scans Top Traders**: Continuously monitors 1000+ traders on Hyperliquid leaderboard
- **Smart Ranking**: Scores traders by win rate, PnL consistency, and risk management
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitors positions and trades of top performers live
- **AI Signals**: Generates trading signals when multiple top traders align (coming soon)
- **Self-Learning**: Improves by analyzing past signal performance (coming soon)
